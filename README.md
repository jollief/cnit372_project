# cnit372_project

-- Use the YouTube Influencer csv file to import data into Oracle SQL Developer

-- First, open a connection to the CNIT 372 database
-- Next, right click on Tables
-- Then click import
-- Choose the file from the zip folder and follow the steps to fix any column name and data type errors
-- Then import and the data will be added to a new table


-- NOTE: Becuase the data did not match perfectly with our Milestone 2 questions, we had to slightly alter the questions in the SQL files.
-- We have noted the questions in each SQL file and the corresponding question from Mileston 2, howver they are slightly altered.
